DLMS - What is it?

Automatic Meter Reading, or more general - Demand Side Management - needs universal definitions, needs communication standards. DLMS/COSEM is the common language so that the partners can understand each other.

DLMS:
“Device Language Message specification” - a generalised concept for abstract modelling of communication entities

COSEM:
“COmpanion Specification for Energy Metering” - sets the rules, based on existing standards, for data exchange with energy meters

- An object model, to view the functionality of the meter, as it is seen at its interface(s)

- An identification system for all metering data

- A messaging method to communicate with the model and to turn the data to a series of bytes

- A transporting method to carry the information between the metering equipment and the data collection system
